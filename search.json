I am Giuseppe Peressotti, 1st year PhD student in Public Policy and Political Economy from The University of Texas at Dallas(EPPS).\nMy main field of study would be International Trade, with a focus on Preferential Trade Agreements. Some of my specific research topics include Digital Provisions in PTAs, the relationship between foreign policy and trade interconnection between states, and the influence of trade ties on the preferential procurement of goods.\nKeep following me for more updates on further work and publications (soon to come).\nYou can find my CV here (WORK IN PROGRESS)."

I will evaluate structural characteristics (centrality levels, balance…) and make inferences based on that.\nI hypothesize that different countries will play different fundamental roles in the network, and that the gravity model is limited in predicting how the actual network of PTAs developed."

    "text": "Original Abstract (without TERGM)\nEntering the current ‘digital era’, as the WTO failed to keep pace with trends in international trade, countries started to take the matter into their own hands and include in their Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) subjects such as e-commerce, the exchange of data, user privacy, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and intellectual property. This new information technology-driven set of policies may lay the foundations to forge new linkages between countries, and possibly define current and future geopolitical networks. However, little is known about how parties actually implement these ‘digital provisions’, as well as what defines which kind of clauses are prioritized by specific parties. This article explores to what extent economic factors and the gravity model can justify the implementation of digital-based provisions in PTAs. It will further make use of network analysis to gauge how well can an economic factors-model predict the centrality of PTA networks based on different kinds of digital clauses, vis-à-vis the actual existing one. Evidence will show how, while such economic factors seem to be relevant in determining how these provisions are implemented, non-economic elements might matter even more. This idea seems to be supported by differences in how distinct levels of centrality are estimated, as well as those pertaining different kinds of digital clauses: networks predicted on the basis of economic factors appear to be heterogeneously different compared to their actual counterparts, meaning that some non-economic elements may play an important role in shaping those PTA networks.\nKeywords: PTA, international trade, digital trade, network analysis, regionalism, gravity model\nSubfield 1: International Political Economy\nSubfield 2: Public Policy"
